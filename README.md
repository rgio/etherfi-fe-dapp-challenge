## Task: Develop a simple dApp that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks using the Ethereum blockchain.
  


### Use Foundry or Hardhat and a local development node(s) to fulfill the following requirements:
  


* Allow users to create a new task and assign it a `name`, `description`, and `due date` 

* Allow users to `view` a list of all tasks, `sorted` by due date. 

* Allow users to `mark` a task as complete and `remove` it from the list.

* The dApp should `use the Ethereum blockchain` to store the list of tasks.

* Include a basic user interface that allows users to interact with the dApp.
  


### Solution
